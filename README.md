# survey__form_freecodecamp
This was a project created as part of my course from Freecodecamp.org, "Responsive Web Design Certification".<br>
All the code was written by me. <br>
The project was also created as image on Figma by me. https://www.figma.com/file/pX9RBfsSMpK04UPVlhGAW7/survey_form_freecodecamp?node-id=0%3A1 <br>
Here's the codepen of the project https://codepen.io/nmelgar/pen/KKayWRY (here, the dropdown lists doesn't work, not sure why, but they work on the project)<br>
